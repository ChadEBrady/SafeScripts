# SafeScripts
## Inspiration
As a parent, I am always concerned for the safety of my kids. If they happen to get into my medications, wether on purpose or accidental, I want to know about it. Being a parent can also make life a bit hectic and I often find myself forgetting to take medication on time or missing a dose completely. SafeScripts can help solve both of these problems.

## What it does
With SafeScripts, I can get real time alerts when my pillbox is opened and I can also set up reminders for when to take my medications. It will continue to send notifications until the box has been opened and I can track any missed doses through the online interface.
