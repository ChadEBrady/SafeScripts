# SafeScripts
SafeScripts is a project built for IOT Hackathon, 2018.

## Inspiration
As a parent, I am always concerned for the safety of my kids. If they happen to get into my medications, wether on purpose or accidental, I want to know about it. Being a parent can also make life a bit hectic and I often find myself forgetting to take medication on time or missing a dose completely. SafeScripts can help solve both of these problems.

## What it does
With SafeScripts, you can get real time alerts when your pillbox is opened and also set up reminders for when to take your medications. The device will continue to send notifications until the box has been opened. The device can additionally track any missed doses through an online interface.
